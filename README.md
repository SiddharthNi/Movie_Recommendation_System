# Movie Recommended System By Using Streamlit.


"Movie Recommended System By Using Streamlit" so basically project done by in py-Charm,I used the streamlit for making application of Movie Recommended System. it's providing the when you selected movie that represent same content related movie like so you selected action movie and famous actor,so it recommended the action movie and same actor movie. I used machine learning recommended topic 

## what is Recommended System in machine Learning ?
In machine learning, the choice of a recommended system depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand. Here are three commonly used recommendation systems:

1.Collaborative Filtering: 

This technique recommends items to users based on their past behaviors and preferences, as well as the behaviors and preferences of similar users. Collaborative filtering can be divided into two subtypes: memory-based and model-based. Memory-based methods use similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) to identify similar users or items, while model-based methods employ algorithms like matrix factorization or deep learning models to learn patterns from user-item interactions.

2.Content-Based Filtering: 

This approach recommends items based on their intrinsic characteristics and features. It involves creating user profiles based on their preferences and then matching those profiles with item profiles. Content-based filtering relies on attributes such as keywords, tags, or metadata to generate recommendations. For example, if a user has shown interest in action movies, the system may recommend other action movies.

3.Hybrid Approaches: 

Hybrid recommendation systems combine multiple techniques, such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, to leverage their complementary strengths. These systems aim to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations by combining the approaches in different ways. For instance, hybrid systems can use collaborative filtering to identify similar users and then use content-based filtering to recommend items based on their characteristics.

It's worth noting that there are other advanced techniques for recommendation systems, including deep learning-based models, reinforcement learning, and contextual recommendation systems. The choice of the best approach depends on factors such as the available data, the complexity of the problem, and the specific objectives of the recommendation system.

## Installation

Install this my project by using jupyter notebook
when you installing jupyter notebook go on homepage of jupyter notebook on right side click on the "upload" and upload my"Movie Recommendation System.ipynb"file. 


```bash
   install jupyter notebook
```
   pandas is data analysis library
```bash
   pip install pandas
```
   numpy offers mathematical function
```bash
   pip install numpy
```

   ast module in the Python standard library can be used to create, visit,    and modify AST related to Python source code.
```bash
   pip install ast
```
   The Sklearn Library is mainly used for modeling data and it provides efficient tools that are easy to use for any kind of predictive data analysis. 
```bash
   pip install scikit-learn
```
   pickle package backports all features and APIs added in the pickle module in Python.
```bash
   pip install pickle5
```

so,this above part is only  of jupyter notebook and python library.

For building a application I used the  streamlit library in Py-Charm development enviorment in python.
```bash
   pip install streamlit
```

## Lessons Learned

1 ) Streamlit library:  gain hands-on experience with the Streamlit library, which is a powerful tool for building interactive web applications. 


2 ) Deployment: Deploying your recommendation system as a web application is a crucial step. You'll learn how to host your Streamlit app on a server and make it accessible to users. This involves configuring servers, managing dependencies, and ensuring smooth deployment.


3 ) Collaborative Filtering: This technique recommends items to users based on their past behaviors and preferences, as well as the behaviors and preferences of similar users. Collaborative filtering can be divided into two subtypes: memory-based and model-based. Memory-based methods use similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) to identify similar users or items, while model-based methods employ algorithms like matrix factorization or deep learning models to learn patterns from user-item interactions.

4 ) Content-Based Filtering: This approach recommends items based on their intrinsic characteristics and features. It involves creating user profiles based on their preferences and then matching those profiles with item profiles. Content-based filtering relies on attributes such as keywords, tags, or metadata to generate recommendations. For example, if a user has shown interest in action movies, the system may recommend other action movies.

5 ) Data preprocessing:  gather and preprocess movie data to make it suitable for the recommendation system. This may involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming it into a suitable format.

6 ) User feedback and improvement: Building a recommendation system is an iterative process. You'll learn how to collect user feedback, analyze it, and use it to improve the system's recommendations.
